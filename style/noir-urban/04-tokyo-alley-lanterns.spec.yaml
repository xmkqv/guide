mood: intimate nocturnal descent

intent: the alley as portal; urban intimacy in narrow spaces

description: |
  A tight Tokyo yokocho alley lined with red paper lanterns.
  Signs crowd overhead—hand-painted kanji, glowing plastic boxes.
  The passage narrows toward a vanishing point of warm light.
  Red dominates: lanterns, banners, the glow of izakaya interiors.
  A single green neon sign punctuates the warmth. Empty crates
  and condensers line the edges. The space is functional, worn, alive.
