mood: isolated urban tension

intent: cinematic alienation; the city as indifferent machine

description: |
  Chicago's LaSalle Street canyon at blue hour. Wet asphalt mirrors
  headlights and the fading salmon sky. High-rises compress the frame,
  creating vertical walls of glass and stone. Cars wait at the crossing,
  anonymous. The Board of Trade building anchors the vanishing point.
  Rain has just passed. The city gleams but offers no warmth.
