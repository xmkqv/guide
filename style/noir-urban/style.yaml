intent: cinematic urban alienation; the city as indifferent presence witnessed after hours

mood: nocturnal solitude with undercurrents of surreal beauty

description: |
  Rain-slicked streets and neon reflections. Empty urban spaces that feel
  inhabited by absence. The color palette splits between cyan and magenta—
  artificial light as emotional temperature. Deep perspective shots draw
  the eye toward vanishing points while wet surfaces double the world.

  This is the city between 2am and dawn: operational but unpeopled,
  beautiful but indifferent. Tokyo alleys and Chicago canyons share the
  same DNA here—vertical compression, reflected light, the theater of
  urban infrastructure revealed when the crowds disappear.

  Warmth exists but is localized: a red lantern, a salmon sky bleeding
  through glass towers. The dominant register is cool detachment punctuated
  by these pools of color.

  summary: |
    Smooth wet surfaces with specular highlights.
    Soft light falloff against hard architectural edges.
    Atmospheric diffusion in distance.
    Aged surfaces in intimate spaces (lanterns, signage).
