mood: nocturnal solitude

intent: urban emptiness as presence; the city after hours

description: |
  An empty street bisected by tram tracks stretches into darkness.
  Magenta bathes the left side—shopfronts, banners, a lone figure.
  Cyan dominates the right—storefronts, traffic lights, deep shadow.
  The color split is almost theatrical, like stage lighting.
  No crowd. No rush. The city holds its breath between moments.
  This is 3am made visible.
