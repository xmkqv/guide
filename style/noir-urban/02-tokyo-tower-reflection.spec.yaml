mood: surreal urban dream

intent: the city as fever dream; reality distorted through wet surfaces

  Tokyo Tower rises against a cyan-pink gradient sky. The bottom half
  of the frame is pure reflection—a rain puddle transforms pavement
  into a mirror world. Traffic lights, pedestrians, vehicles all doubled.
  The color grade pushes toward the unreal: teal shadows, coral highlights.
  Everything shimmers. The boundary between solid and liquid dissolves.

  - Masashi Wakui Tokyo night photography

composition:
