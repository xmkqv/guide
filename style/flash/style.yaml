intent: |
  Professional confidence with latent energy. The aesthetic of people who have
  nothing to prove but everything to build. Intellectual without being cold,
  ambitious without being loud. A tennis pro at a charity doubles match.

mood: quiet power with veiled intensity

description: |
  Restrained surfaces with occasional controlled explosions of color.
  Negative space is a feature, not emptiness. Every object earns its place.
  The style draws from Scandinavian calm and Swiss precision, but isn't afraid
  of warmth—mustard, blush, orange appear as confident punctuation.
  Industrial materials (concrete, steel) meet considered design (Vignelli, Finn Juhl).
  The vibe says: serious work happens here, and we have taste.

composition:
  summary: |
    Sparse by default. Negative space as deliberate choice.
    Asymmetric but balanced. Single focal points.

texture:
  summary: |
    Smooth, matte surfaces dominate. Raw concrete as counterpoint.
    Clean edges with occasional organic relief (plants, wood grain).
    No noise, no grain, no distress.
