mood: controlled explosion

intent: energy held in check; humor without trying too hard; the startup energy veiled

  A megaphone floats in monochromatic orange space.
  The object implies loudness, broadcast, announcement—but is silent.
  Playful and serious at once. A wink, not a laugh.
  This is the "explosive energy" with a thin veil over it.
